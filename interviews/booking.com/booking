F2F: 2 - Frontend (Two interviewers)

Create a function to fetch and render an array of stocks (stock_id, stock_name, price).

Follow up questions:

- Automatically refresh data (your solution must be "user-friendly". ex. re-render every 3 seconds)

- Create an additional list of "3 Favorite stocks" and link it to the bottom of the page. (use "div", use position: fixed; bottom: 0). On this step, they asked a lot about CSS Position (absolute, fixed, etc)

- What if there are 10000+ stocks? Should we render them all? Should we re-fetch them all? (Answer: re-fetch/re-render only first N of stocks + re-fetch/re-render favorite stocks)
