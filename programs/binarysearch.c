/*
int mid = (low + high)/2;
But if we calculate the middle index like this means our code is not 100% correct, it contains bugs.
That is, it fails for larger values of int variables low and high. 
Specifically, it fails if the sum of low and high is greater than the maximum positive int value(231 â€“ 1 ).
